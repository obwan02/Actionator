# Actionator

A tool/dashboard generator to perform remote actions.

## Design/Tooling Decisions

### Final Decision
After debating between idea #1 and #2, I've decided to do both :)

### Idea #1
- Backend: `Python`, `FastAPI`, auto-generate API routes, and stream data back over `WebSocket`
- Frontend: `HTML`, `JS`, `CSS`, with [GoldenLayout](https://golden-layout.com/tutorials/getting-started.html) to manage layout
    - `JS` and `HTML` would all be auto-generated by Python at start-up
    - **OR** `JS` creates all layout auto-magically by hitting up an endpoint that list all possible endpoints


**PROS**
- All client needs to access the dashboard is a web-browser
- WebSocket is a reliable protocol, and makes it easy to send categorised data
- Styling is somewhat easy
- Maintenance is easy, as `JS` *potentially* could be fully auto-generated so Python is the only
  language needed to get started

**CONS**
- Favourite CSS libs don't work too well with `GoldenLayout` ... would have to roll manual CSS
- `GoldenLayout` is somewhat unmaintained atm
- `GoldenLayout` layout is somewhat dated,  and lacks features

### Idea #2
- Backend: `Python`, `FastAPI`, auto-generate API routes, and stream data back over `UDP` or `TCP`
- Frontend: `Dear ImGui`, using `libcurl` for http requests, and `TCP`/`UDP` to get back responses

**PROS**
- Sounds fun as hell
- `Dear ImGui` is great for 'cool' looking UIs :)) 
- `Dear ImGui` is really customisable, and looks good out of the box

**CONS**
- Can't autogen the frontend ...
